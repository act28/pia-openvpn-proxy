<!-- A good PR:

  - Is small
  - Contains a single change that makes sense in isolation
  - Makes the code better
-->

<!-- A good PR title:

  - Ends the sentence "If applied, this PR will ..."
  - Is less than 50 characters
  - Uses sentence case with no trailing period

Example: Add tournament start notifications
-->

<!-- Before you submit:

You should have reviewed the entire diff line-by-line and know what you're
submitting. If that sounds too hard, your PR is too big.
-->

<!-- If requesting reviews:

It will probably be assumed that you're asking for a full code review. Use
review requests sparingly, or they are likely to be ignored.

If you're after more general guidance, you need to follow up with a comment
indicating what you're after. Often a face-to-face discussion is quicker and
better for this purpose.
